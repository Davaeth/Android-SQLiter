# Android-SQLiter

  Second application to school. Application is about to learn working with SQLite database.

  Main functionality is about to save, delete and update data from DB. Then app lists every data that is in local db. From edit page user can edit data, delete it or to another site.
  My bonus is that I've added user sign in/up system with relations. User can login to application and listed data will be related to him. One user can see only his related data.
